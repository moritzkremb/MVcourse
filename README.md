# Machine Vision Course

These are the exercises for an old-school Machine Vision course (held at TU Wien), which includes the ground-up implementations of some common machine vision algorithms. Coding these algorithms can help to aid your understanding of the fundamentals of machine vision.

+ Exercise 1: Canny Edge Detection
+ Exercise 2: Harris Corner Detector & Interest Points
+ Exercise 3: Object Detection with SIFT and GHT
+ Exercise 4: Plane fitting with RANSAC
+ Exercise 5: Clustering
+ Exercise 6: 3D Object Recognition
